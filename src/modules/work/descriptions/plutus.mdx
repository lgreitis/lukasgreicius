As a bachelor thesis I have decided to make a Steam inventory tracker tool that I have wanted to make since I have started programming.

My previous attempts have failed due to the lack of knowledge and experience back then, but as I have learned more and more I thought this would be a great idea for a bachelor's thesis.
The end product was great and I've learned a lot of things along the way and ofcourse got a full mark for this project.

This project was split into two parts:

- Next.js website using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS and TRPC.
- Node.js workers made with BullMQ.

This deploment diagram should give some idea of what's going on

## Next.js website

The website was nothing special it used the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) which is a great bolerplate for fullstack applications.
The only problem was the Prisma ORM which is **SLOOOW**. The Ubuntu server which can be seen in the diagram was hosted on my old laptop on WIFI
and that created huge bottlenecks in my website. The bottlenecks were so bad that I had to cache some responses on [Upstash](https://upstash.com/).
Prisma was the problem because it created some really bad queries that really bogged down my old quadcore cpu. I could have written my own queries,
but it was too late for this project. I might rewrite this project in the future and use something like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), which looks very cool.

## Node.js workers

This is my favourite part. It was my first time using workers and I didn't really know how I should organize the code, so it was kind of a mess.
I have used [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) which had everything I needed and was very easy to use.
Combined with [PM2 process manager](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) I had a weird, but functional Microservice architecture.

I have made 5 workers for this project:

- Api price worker
- Exchange price worker
- Mail worker
- Official price worker
- Inventory worker

And one "worker" that was just a Discord bot.

This description is still in the making. I will fill in some more information and some screenshots later.
