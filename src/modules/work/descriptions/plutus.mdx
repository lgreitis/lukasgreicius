As a bachelor thesis I have decided to make a Steam inventory tracker tool that I have wanted to make since I have started programming.

My previous attempts have failed due to the lack of knowledge and experience back then, but as I have learned more and more I thought this would be a great idea for a bachelor's thesis.
The end product was great and I've learned a lot of things along the way and ofcourse got a full mark for this project.

This project was split into two parts:

- Next.js website using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS and TRPC.
- Node.js workers made with BullMQ.

This deploment diagram should give some idea of what's going on

## Next.js website

The website was nothing special it used the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) which is a great bolerplate for fullstack applications.
I really liked this stack, but the only problem was the Prisma ORM which was very slow.

## Node.js workers

This is my favourite part. It was my first time using workers and I didn't really know how I should organize the code, so it was kind of a mess.
I have used [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) which had everything I needed and was very easy to use.
Combined with [PM2 process manager](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) I had a weird, but functional Microservice architecture.

I have made 5 workers for this project:

- Api price worker - Gets price from [SteamApis](https://steamapis.com/), from where I get additional information about an item. I aim to replace this service with my own logic. This is ran daily.
- Exchange price worker - Gets currency exchange info so I can support lots of different currencies. Ran daily to get the latest exchange rate.
- Mail worker - Sends monthly emails about user's portfolio.
- Official price worker - Scrapes the data from Steam website to get various information about an item. This is ran continiously with every item in CS:GO.
- Inventory worker - Scrapes user's inventory to get all of user's owned items. This is ran when user requests inventory refresh.

And one "worker" that was just a Discord bot.

The coolest part of my project is that all of the ~120,000 items finish updating in around 6 hours, which is pretty fast, considering Steam's rate limiting and the fact that I'm not using any paid proxy services.
Additionally, this was accomplished on an old laptop with 4 threads and a Wi-Fi connection, to minimize costs.

## As of December 2023, I have begun the process of remaking this project, aiming to add further features, improve performance and ultimately release it to the public.
